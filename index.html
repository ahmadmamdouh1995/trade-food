                    <p> Food is the great unifier that connects us across cultures and generations. We have all had those moments when we smelled something that reminded us of our childhood,
                        or recreated a dish that we had abroad that immediately brought us back to that foreign place.
                        Food can quite literally propel you to another time, another country, another culture without even leaving your dinner table,
                        which is why food culture is such an important way that we as people are able to connect and relate to one another.
                        As a dual-Italian American citizen, my family’s food culture was something that nourished not only my body but my soul. It was a part of how I connected with my grandparents,
                        it was the lens through which I learned about the environment and where food came from,
                        it was how I bonded with my mom and sisters as I learned how to make homemade marinara sauce from the tomatoes my dad grew in our garden. 
                        My food culture was as much a part of my me as I was a part of my food culture, and as I got older and began traveling the world exploring the food cultures of the world and the way in which they nourish our bodies differently,
                        I began to better understand how my own food culture was able to give me a natural appreciation and sense of connection for the way in which food, local ingredients, and traditions can connect us as people — even when nothing else seems possible.

                    <p>Traditional food
                        Traditional foods are foods and dishes that are passed through generations or which have been consumed many generations. Traditional foods and dishes are traditional in nature, and may have a historic precedent in a national dish, regional cuisine or local cuisine. Traditional foods and beverages may be produced as homemade, by restaurants and small manufacturers, and by large food processing plant facilities.Some traditional foods have geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union designations per European Union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties: Protected designation of origin (PDO), Protected geographical indication (PGI) and Traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG). These standards serve to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.This article also includes information about traditional beverages.    </p>
